# Braille-to-text-translator
Braille is a tactile writing system used by people who are visually impaired, including people who are blind, deafblind or who have low vision. Slate and stylus instead of paper and pen are used to write Braille. Hands instead of eyes are used to read it. This makes a completely different system for reading and writing than as usual. So, for a long time there is a formal communication gap between visually impaired and normal people.
The aim of this project is to reduce the gap between visually impired and normal people by means of technology. This system adopted Braille rules and practices for Bangladesh. It can detect Bengali digit, letter, joint-letter, punctuations and english characters.
This is a desktop software which takes scanned Braille images as input and produces corresponding text as output by following Bengali Braille rules.
